            <h2 class="intl-section-title">Experience Narrative</h2>
            <div class="intl-narrative-content">
                <p>I joined the International Affairs Office at Daffodil International University to gain exposure to international collaboration and professional communication in a global context. The office works with partner institutions and stakeholders from different countries, and this environment helped me understand how international coordination and cross cultural communication function in practice.</p>
                
                <p>During the internship, I worked on content writing, communication support, and event management activities. These tasks were not limited to internal coordination. They contributed to students, international guests, and partner institutions by ensuring clear information sharing and organized engagement. I frequently interacted, directly and indirectly, with international guests and delegates, which strengthened my confidence in professional communication.</p>
                
                <p>Working with people from different backgrounds significantly improved my communication mindset. I learned that tone, clarity, and cultural awareness matter when working in international settings. When international guests visited the university, I had to adjust communication styles based on context and responsibility, which was a valuable learning experience.</p>
                
                <p>This internship also showed me the importance of systems and coordination. Different departments needed to work together smoothly for events and communications to be successful. I observed that without proper coordination, even small tasks could become inefficient. This helped me understand how structured collaboration supports larger institutional goals.</p>
                
                <p>The experience prepared me well for working in international and multicultural environments. It directly supports my work today with international clients and aligns with my interest in global academic programs such as Erasmus Mundus. The communication skills and professional discipline I developed continue to influence how I manage clients, teams, and responsibilities in BuildSign.</p>
                
                <p>Through this internship, I learned that international exposure is not only about global interaction, but also about responsibility, professionalism, and cultural sensitivity. This experience plays a meaningful role in my long term goal of pursuing impact oriented work in an international setting.</p>
                
                <p>I joined the International Affairs office because I wanted to step into professional life and experience an environment that felt more global. Our university works with more than five hundred universities worldwide, so I knew that working here would give me an international vibe and help me understand how communication works across cultures.</p>
                
                <p>During the internship I worked on content writing, communication and event management. Most of the tasks were simple but they taught me how to stay organized, how to talk clearly and how to support people when they need help. I also learned how different departments work together, which was a new experience for me.</p>
                
                <p>The thing that made me happy was the people I worked with. My fellow interns were dedicated and hardworking, and today many of them are doing very well in their own fields. Being part of that group made me feel proud and grateful.</p>
                
                <p>This internship helped me grow in many ways. It improved my communication, teamwork, responsibility and confidence. It also taught me how to behave in a professional space and how to understand people from different backgrounds. Later, when I started BuildSign, these lessons helped me manage my team better, communicate with clients and maintain a calm and steady work style. It was a small part of my journey but a meaningful one.</p>
